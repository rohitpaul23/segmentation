# segmentation

This repository contains two files each using different model for image segmentation they are:
1. FCN8Segmentation: Used FCN-8 decoder to do image segmentation on M2NIST dataset
2. UNetSegmentation: Used U-Net for semantic Image segmentation on Oxfoed IIIT Pet dataset

** The projects are made by taking help from deeplearning.ai courses on TensorFlow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization
